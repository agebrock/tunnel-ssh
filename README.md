# Tunnel-SSH

⚠️ **See https://github.com/DeepChannel/tunnel-ssh for why this exists in DeepChannel. Note that tunnel-ssh@4.1.6 has now been published to npm and so we can delete this repo once we are sure we don't have any builds left that depend on it** ⚠️

One to connect them all !

Tunnel-ssh is based on the fantastic [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) library by Brian White.
Trouble ? Please study the ssh2 configuration.

### Latest Relese 4.1.3

### Integration

By default tunnel-ssh will close the tunnel after a client disconnects, so your cli tools should work in the same way, they do if you connect directly.
If you need the tunnel to stay open, use the "keepAlive:true" option within
the configuration.

```js

    var config = {
      ...
      keepAlive:true
    };

    var tnl = tunnel(config, function(error, tnl){
          yourClient.connect();
          yourClient.disconnect();
          setTimeout(function(){
            // you only need to close the tunnel by yourself if you set the
            // keepAlive:true option in the configuration !
            tnl.close();
          },2000);
      });

    // you can also close the tunnel from here...
    setTimeout(function(){
      tnl.close();
    },2000);

```

## Understanding the configuration

1. A local server listening for connections to forward via ssh
   Description: This is where you bind your interface.
   Properties:
   ** localHost (default is '127.0.0.1')
   ** localPort (default is dstPort)

2. The ssh configuration
   Description: The host you want to use as ssh-tunnel server.
   Properties:
   ** host
   ** port (22)
   ** username
   ** ...

3. The destination host configuration (based on the ssh host)
   Imagine you just connected to The host you want to connect to. (via host:port)
   now that server connects requires a target to tunnel to.
   Properties:
   ** dstHost (localhost)
   ** dstPort

### Config example

```js
var config = {
  username: "root",
  password: "secret",
  host: sshServer,
  port: 22,
  dstHost: destinationServer,
  dstPort: 27017,
  localHost: "127.0.0.1",
  localPort: 27000,
};

var tunnel = require("tunnel-ssh");
tunnel(config, function (error, server) {
  //....
});
```

#### Sugar configuration

tunnel-ssh assumes that you want to map the same port on a remote machine to your localhost using the ssh-server on the remote machine.

```js
var config = {
  username: "root",
  dstHost: "remotehost.with.sshserver.com",
  dstPort: 27017,
  privateKey: require(fs).readFileSync("/path/to/key"),
  passphrase: "secret",
};
```

#### More configuration options

tunnel-ssh pipes the configuration direct into the ssh2 library so every config option provided by ssh2 still works.
[ssh2 configuration](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#client-methods)

#### catching errors:

```js
var tunnel = require("tunnel-ssh");
//map port from remote 3306 to localhost 3306
var server = tunnel(
  { host: "172.16.0.8", dstPort: 3306 },
  function (error, server) {
    if (error) {
      //catch configuration and startup errors here.
    }
  }
);

// Use a listener to handle errors outside the callback
server.on("error", function (err) {
  console.error("Something bad happened:", err);
});
```
